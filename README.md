(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.
    -Counter increments by default by 1/sec.
    -Counter increases by 1 when biscuit is pressed.
    -Buying biscuit manufacturers increases the default counter increments per second.
    -Biscuit has animation when hovered / pressed.
    -More or less responsive design and layout.
    -Used intervals and timeout for counter increment and animation of biscuit.


🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

    -Was not able to store some of the things on local storage.
    
    - Did not attempt to add upgrades with API's, 

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

    -Local storage : got the counter of biscuits to fully save and retrieve from local storage, but couldn't make the purchased biscuit manufacturers save on local storage, every page reload it goes to 0,
    tried many different variations and every time something else broke/changed. one point got the purchased manufacturers to save after reload, but then if i press buy on cottage, the purchased quantity would start from 0 again. 

    - API: Didn't have enough time.

    - Everything was going well until i got fully stuck with the local storage part, counter works as it should and saves / updates displayed figures correctly, but purchased manufacturers just couldn't make it work.

(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
 
What went really well and what could have gone better?
    - Most of the assignment was great and blasted through it, but then once I needed to save/retrieve/update displayed values using local storage, I got stuck and wasted so much time on it without success.
    -

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.
    - Trying to save table data and update table data caused all the errors, I struggled to find ways to debug it properly.



Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.
    - Would like to know where i went wrong with local storage and my table content, why it wouldn't update the table with local storage values, at one point (before i broke it) it did save the values and retrieved them correctly, but afte reload if i'd press buy, it would start from 0, even if the displayed figure was anything but 0.
